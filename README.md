## Contributing
If you would like to help, please contact **LeNerd46#0316** on Discord
<br />I don't know much about making games on calculators, so I would appreciate help

## Building
I believe everything should be there, so download the source code and run `make gfx` then `make`

I don't know how much I am going to actually push to this for *legal* reasons
