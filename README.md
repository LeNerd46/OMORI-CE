# OMORI-CE
A port of OMORI to the TI-84 Plus CE

> **Warning** 
<br />THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS<br />Due to the limitations of the calculator (mainly memory I think), this is almost impossible to continue. It was a fun project, but I'm not sure if I can continue unfortunately

### Current Progress:
- [x] Main Menu
- [x] Whitespace
- [ ] Neighbor's Room
- [ ] Vast Forest

## Contributing
If you would like to help, please contact **LeNerd46#0316** on Discord
<br />I don't know much about making games on calculators, so I would appreciate help

## Building
I believe everything should be there, so download the source code and run `make gfx` then `make`

I don't know how much I am going to actually push to this for *legal* reasons
